Experiment 2 ‚Äì Backend Development Basics
Week 1: Introduction to Backend Development
Objective

Understand the basics of backend development and how to create RESTful APIs.

Lab Activities

Overview of HTTP methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE

Introduction to REST architecture

Building a simple RESTful API using Node.js and Express

Sample Project

Create an API for managing a list of items (such as a to-do list) using HTTP modules and the Express framework.

Requirements

Node.js installed

npm (comes with Node.js)

A code editor (VS Code recommended)

Expected Output

GET: Fetch all items in the list

POST: Add a new item

PUT: Update an existing item

DELETE: Remove an item

Would you like me to also prepare the same simple README for Experiment 1 so both experiments follow the same format?

Experiment 1 ‚Äì Node.js File Handling and Modules
Objective

To practice Node.js concepts like modules, file handling, and streams.

Lab Activities

Export nested objects and functions using exports.

Read a file asynchronously and handle errors if the file is not found.

Read a text file on the server using http and fs modules.

Use a Readable stream to read data from a file (data.txt) and print it to the console.

Create a Writable stream to write "Hello, Node.js!" to a file (output.txt).

Demonstrate stream piping by copying content from input.txt to output.txt.

Requirements

Node.js installed

npm (comes with Node.js)

A code editor (VS Code recommended)

Expected Output

Exported modules work correctly.

File contents displayed on the console or served through HTTP.

Errors handled properly if files are missing.

output.txt created with "Hello, Node.js!".

Stream piping copies file content successfully.
