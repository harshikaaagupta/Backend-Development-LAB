				Experiment No 1

Write code for above questions:

1: Exporting nested objects and function from Module using exports Object.

2: Reading into a file asynchronously and writing code for handling error if file not found to read.

3: Reading a text file on the server using http and fs module.

4: Write a program that uses a Readable stream to read data from a file (data.txt). Output the file content to the console. Ensure the file exists before reading, and handle any errors if the file is missing.

5: Write a program that creates a Writable stream to write a string ("Hello, Node.js!") to a file (output.txt). If the file already exists, overwrite it. Print a success message once the data is written.


6: Write a program that demonstrates stream piping. Use a Readable stream to read data from a file (input.txt), and pipe it to a Writable stream that writes to another file (output.txt).
