**Experiment 1 â€“ Node.js File Handling and Modules**
Objective

To practice Node.js concepts like modules, file handling, and streams.

Lab Activities

Export nested objects and functions using exports.

Read a file asynchronously and handle errors if the file is not found.

Read a text file on the server using http and fs modules.

Use a Readable stream to read data from a file (data.txt) and print it to the console.
